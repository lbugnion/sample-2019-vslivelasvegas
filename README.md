## Azure 101

**Abstract:** 'There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computerâ€¦' That is true. But when this someone else is Microsoft, and takes care of all the maintenance of these huge server farms, you can redirect these resources used to take care of your own infrastructure to other important tasks, such as adding features for your users. However, at first sight, Microsoft Azure and its huge offering can seem daunting for a new user. In this presentation, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Developer Advocate with Azure will show you how he got started and how you too can take advantage of the services that the Microsoft Cloud has to offer. Together we will discover the Azure Portal as well as quite a few tools that make your life as a cloud developer easier

## Taking Advantage of AI easily with Azure Cognitive Services

**Abstract:** Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are fascinating areas of computing. Microsoft is betting a lot on these new technologies, but we are also aware that data scientists are highly trained professionals, and that not every software developer can create and maintain complex data models, perform linear algebra or purchase expensive GPU rigs to run these models. This is exactly why we created Cognitive services. This suite of services offers pre-trained models that you can use out-of-the-box to perform operations in Vision, Speech, Knowledge, Search and Language. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Developer Advocate with Microsoft will show you how you can use cognitive services to enhance your applications with advanced capabilities, how you can refine the trained models with your own data and how you can integrate Cognitive Services with other Azure services to automate tasks.
